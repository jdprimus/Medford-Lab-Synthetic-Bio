Projects and contributions to in my time working as a Research Associate with the Medford Lab in plant synthetic biology

These are various project files which I created while working in plant synthetic biology.  The most extensive work was using Approximate Bayesian Computation (an MCMC type approach) to fit experimental data to a mechanistic model of a positive autoregulatory genetic circuit in plants.  
Other projects include user apps for data analysis, implementing algorithms such as PCA, LDA, and image processing techniques.  These were apps for classification and screening to develop a high throughput workflow.
Other mathematical models relevant to the output of genetic circuits can be found here as well.
